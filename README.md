A DIY Home Automation System Using open source materials

The future is smart, the future is automated. The future belongs to the people.

Currently, as we are all aware, the majority of the innovations in technology that are available to the every-day individual are controlled by large corporations. The window through which the every-day person can conceive, develop, and produce their own technological innovations, on the scale of a full home automation system, is small.

This project concerned itself with the future of smart home automation(IOT), digital assistants(Siri, Google Home, Alexa), and the ever growing presence of voice recognition technologies(NLP). These concepts, and developing a user-friendly and accessible play that everyone can create and self educate in terms of developing their own technologies.

Our goal was to develop a system that was inexpensive and accessible to everyone. In addition, we found that many of our users would be individuals with little to no experience in technology. Our product had to be easy to install and customize for the user.

In keeping the cost to within an acceptable margin, we employed the concepts of up-cycling old technologies, creating within the boundaries of inexpensive microprocessors and microcomputers running open source software as well as basic code written by the team.

Exploring these concepts we examined the two sides of the home of the future. 
Automation: the sensing and collecting of data and Control: the user interface by which the resident home owner lives within a smart system.
